A bundle is an isolated piece of logic e.g. search

Intentionally dodging around CQRS, DDD and other fascinating subjects for now just to be able to wire 
this app together.

In the context of nestjs this rhymes almost 1 to 1 with a module.

A bundle can have one or more modules in it, some utility code and tests.

Hopefully some of this can be farmed out as standalone nestjs plugins.
